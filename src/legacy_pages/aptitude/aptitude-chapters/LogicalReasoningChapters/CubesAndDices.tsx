        This chapter of visual reasoning tests your ability to visualize 3D objects. Problems involving <strong>dices</strong> focus on understanding the relationship between opposite and adjacent faces. Problems involving <strong>cubes</strong> test your ability to count smaller cubes formed from a larger one, based on how many of their faces are painted.

        A standard die is a cube with faces numbered 1 through 6. The key property is that the sum of the numbers on <strong>opposite faces is always 7</strong>.

            <li>Opposite to 1 is <strong>6</strong> (1 + 6 = 7)</li>
            <li>Opposite to 2 is <strong>5</strong> (2 + 5 = 7)</li>
            <li>Opposite to 3 is <strong>4</strong> (3 + 4 = 7)</li>

      <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground">
        In reasoning problems, you are often shown two or more views of the same die and asked to find the number on the face opposite to a given number.

        <p className="mt-2 text-muted-foreground">A simpler way is to write the adjacent faces in clockwise order. <br/><strong>Example:</strong> In two views, '4' is common. <br/> View 1: Clockwise from 4 gives `4 â†’ 1 â†’ 2`. <br/> View 2: Clockwise from 4 gives `4 â†’ 6 â†’ 5`.<br/> Then, 1 is opposite 6, 2 is opposite 5, and the remaining number (3) is opposite 4.</p>

        5. Key Strategy Summary
      </h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
        <li><strong>For Dice:</strong> Look for common faces between different views. If one face is common, use the clockwise rule. If two faces are common, the remaining faces are opposite.</li>
        <li><strong>For Cubes:</strong> First, find the value of 'N'. If a cube is cut into 64 smaller cubes, then NÂ³ = 64, so N = 4.</li>
        <li><strong>Memorize the Formulas:</strong> The four formulas for painted cubes (3-face, 2-face, 1-face, 0-face) are constant and should be memorized.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualize:</strong> Try to visualize the cube. The 3-face painted cubes are corners, 2-face are edges, and 1-face are centers. This helps in understanding the formulas.</li>
