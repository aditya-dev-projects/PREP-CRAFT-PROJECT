      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        Direction Sense problems are a common type of logical puzzle in placement tests. They are designed to test your spatial reasoning and ability to visualize movement and position. These questions require you to follow a path of a person or object and determine their final direction or distance from the starting point. The key is to always <strong>draw a clear diagram</strong>.

      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        All direction problems are based on the standard compass directions. It is crucial to have a clear mental map of this. The rule is to always assume that <strong>North</strong> is pointing upwards on your paper.
