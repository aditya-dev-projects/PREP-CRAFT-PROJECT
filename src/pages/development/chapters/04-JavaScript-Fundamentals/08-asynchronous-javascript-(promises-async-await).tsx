      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        By default, JavaScript is a **synchronous**, single-threaded language, meaning it executes one line of code at a time, in order. However, many web operations, like fetching data from a server or waiting for a timer, can take time. **Asynchronous JavaScript** is the mechanism that allows the browser to perform these long-running tasks without freezing the entire webpage, ensuring a smooth user experience.

            <li><strong>Asynchronous Work:</strong> A real chef works asynchronously. They take an order, put a steak on the grill (a long-running task), and while it's cooking, they can chop vegetables for the next order. They don't block their workflow; they start a task and get notified when it's done. This is how asynchronous JavaScript works.</li>

        2. The Old Way: Callbacks and "Callback Hell"
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Originally, asynchronous operations were handled with **callback functions**. A callback is a function that you pass as an argument to another function, which is then executed once the main task is complete. While functional, nesting multiple callbacks leads to a messy, hard-to-read structure known as "Callback Hell" or the "Pyramid of Doom."

        A **Promise** is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It's a placeholder for a future value.

        8. Key Strategy for Asynchronous JavaScript
      </h2>
       <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
        <li><strong>Embrace `async/await`:</strong> For all new code, prefer the `async/await` syntax over `.then()` chains. It is much cleaner, easier to read, and simpler to debug.</li>
        <li><strong>Always Handle Errors:</strong> Asynchronous operations can fail for many reasons (e.g., network issues). Always include error handling, either with a `.catch()` block for promises or a `try...catch` block for `async/await`.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand What `await` Does:</strong> Remember that `await` literally pauses your function. This is incredibly powerful for writing sequential logic but be mindful not to block code unnecessarily.</li>
        <li><strong>Use `Promise.all` for Concurrent Operations:</strong> If you need to run multiple asynchronous operations at the same time and wait for all of them to finish, use `Promise.all()`. This is much more efficient than awaiting them one by one.</li>
