        Branching is arguably the most powerful feature of Git. It allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work in isolation without affecting that main line. This chapter covers the essential commands for creating, switching between, and merging branches, which is the core of collaborative and feature-based development.

      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Think of your main codebase (often called the `main` or `master` branch) as your project's "official timeline." A branch is like creating a copy of this timeline where you can safely experiment with a new feature.

            <li>You can make changes, commit, and break things in your new branch without any impact on the stable, main timeline.</li>
            <li>Once you are happy with your new feature, you can **merge** your experimental timeline back into the official one, incorporating your changes.</li>
            <li>If the feature doesn't work out, you can simply delete the branch (the parallel universe) with no side effects.</li>

        4. Dealing with Merge Conflicts
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two branches. This happens when the **same line of code** was changed in both the branches you are trying to merge.
      </p>
      <div className="p-4 mt-4 bg-muted rounded-lg border border-border">
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">When a conflict occurs, Git will pause the merge and mark the conflicting lines in the file with special markers:</p>
        <pre className="mt-2 p-2 bg-black rounded-md text-white text-sm"><code>
              {'<<<<<<< HEAD'}<br/>
              {'  // Code from your current branch (e.g., main)'}<br/>
              {'======='}<br/>
              {'  // Code from the branch you are merging in (e.g., new-feature)'}<br/>
              {'>>>>>>> new-feature'}

        <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2 text-muted-foreground space-y-2">
            <li>Open the conflicted file in your code editor.</li>
            <li>Manually edit the file to keep the code you want and delete the conflicting code and the special markers.</li>
            <li>Save the file.</li>
            {/* FIX: Correctly escaped angle brackets for JSX */}
            <li>Run `git add {'<conflicted-file-name>'}` to mark the conflict as resolved.</li>

        <li><strong>Start on `main`:</strong> Make sure your main branch is up-to-date.</li>

        <li><strong>Work and Commit:</strong> Make all your code changes and commit them to your new feature branch.</li>
        <li><strong>Merge:</strong> When the feature is complete and tested, switch back to your `main` branch and merge your feature branch into it.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete the Branch (Optional):</strong> After a successful merge, you can delete your feature branch to keep your repository clean (`git branch -d user-login-form`).</li>
