      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        While you can technically add React to any webpage with a simple script tag, modern React development relies on a powerful set of build tools. These tools handle complex tasks like bundling your code, transpiling modern JavaScript, and optimizing for production. Tools like **Create React App (CRA)** and the more modern **Vite** provide a pre-configured setup, allowing you to start building your application without worrying about the complex configuration.

        1. The Core Concept: The Code Factory üè≠
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Think of a build tool as a factory assembly line for your code. You write your code in a modern, developer-friendly way (using JSX, ES6+ features, and multiple files). The build tool then takes all these raw materials and assembles them into a final product: a small set of highly optimized, static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that any web browser can understand.

        2. What is Create React App (CRA)?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Create React App was the original, official command-line tool from Facebook for creating React projects. For years, it was the standard way to start a new application. It pre-configures everything you need, including a development server, a build process, and a testing environment, with zero configuration required from the developer.

        3. Introducing Vite: The Modern & Faster Alternative
      </h2>
       <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        While CRA is still functional, the modern and officially recommended tool for starting a new React project is **Vite** (pronounced "veet," French for "fast"). Vite serves the same purpose as CRA but uses modern browser features to provide a significantly faster development experience.
      </p>
      <div className="p-4 mt-4 bg-muted rounded-lg border border-border">
          <p className="text-secondary-foreground font-semibold">Why Vite is Preferred Now:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
            <li><strong>Instant Server Start:</strong> Vite's development server starts almost instantly, regardless of your project's size.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot Module Replacement (HMR):</strong> When you change your code, only that specific module is updated in the browser, without losing your application's state. This is much faster than the full-page reloads common with older tools.</li>
          </ul>

        8. Key Strategy for Project Setup
      </h2>
       <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
        <li><strong>Use Vite for New Projects:</strong> For any new React project, Vite is the recommended and superior choice over the older Create React App.</li>
        <li><strong>Understand the `src` Folder:</strong> This is your workspace. All the components you create will live inside this folder. It's a common practice to create a `components` subfolder inside `src` to keep your code organized.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust `npm install`:</strong> When you download a project from GitHub, it won't have the `node_modules` folder. The first thing you must do is run `npm install` to download all the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.</li>
        {/* FIX: Escaped the <div> tag to be valid JSX */}
        <li><strong>`index.html` is the Anchor:</strong> Remember that even in a complex React app, there is still only one `index.html` file. React takes over a single `&lt;div&gt;` (usually with an id of "root") inside this file and renders the entire application within it.</li>
