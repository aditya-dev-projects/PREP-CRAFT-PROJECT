      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        Data Sufficiency is a unique type of logical reasoning question that tests your ability to determine what information is necessary to solve a problem, rather than actually solving the problem itself. Each question consists of a question followed by two statements, labeled (1) and (2). Your task is to decide whether the data provided in the statements is sufficient to answer the question.

        1. The Core Concept: "Can it be solved?" not "What is the answer?"
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        This is the most important mindset shift required for Data Sufficiency. You are not required to find the final numerical answer. You only need to check if you *can* find a unique answer with the given information.
      </p>
      <div className="p-4 mt-4 bg-muted rounded-lg border border-border">
        <p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> If you can determine a single, unique answer to the question using the data in the statements, then the data is sufficient. If the data leads to multiple possible answers or no answer at all, it is insufficient.</p>

                    <li>From `2x + 4 = 10`, we can solve for x: `2x = 6`, so `x = 3`.</li>
                    <li>This gives a unique answer. Therefore, Statement (1) is <strong>SUFFICIENT</strong>.</li>
                    <li>At this point, the final answer must be either (A) or (D). We can eliminate options (B), (C), and (E). This is the "AD" part of the strategy.</li>

        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
            <li><strong>Solving Too Much:</strong> Remember, you don't need the final answer. As soon as you are certain that a unique answer *can* be found, the statement is sufficient. Don't waste time on lengthy calculations.</li>
            <li><strong>"Yes/No" Questions:</strong> For questions that can be answered with a "Yes" or a "No" (e.g., "Is x an even number?"), a statement is sufficient if it gives a definite "Yes" or a definite "No". If the statement leads to a "maybe" situation, it is insufficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Assuming Information:</strong> Do not use information from Statement (1) when you are analyzing Statement (2) alone. This is the most common mistake. Treat them as completely separate worlds initially.</li>
            <li><strong>Square Root Trap:</strong> If an equation is `xÂ² = 9`, the solution is `x = 3` or `x = -3`. This is not a unique answer. A statement like "x is a positive number" would be needed to make it sufficient.</li>
