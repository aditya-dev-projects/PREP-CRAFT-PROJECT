      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        Word Pattern, also known as Analogy, is a common type of verbal reasoning question in placement tests. These questions test your vocabulary and, more importantly, your ability to identify the logical <strong>relationship</strong> between a pair of words. Your task is to find a second pair of words that has the exact same relationship as the first pair.

        1. The Core Concept: The Bridge Sentence ðŸŒ‰
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Every analogy problem follows the structure `A : B :: C : D`, which is read as "A is to B as C is to D". The key to solving these is to create a short, clear sentence, called a "bridge sentence," that perfectly describes the relationship between A and B. You then apply this exact sentence to find the correct D.

            <li><strong>Step 1 (Find Relationship):</strong> A fish uses gills to breathe.</li>

            <li><strong>Step 3 (Apply to Second Pair):</strong> "A <strong>HUMAN</strong> breathes using his/her <strong>LUNGS</strong>."</li>

        <li><strong>Identify the Relationship:</strong> First, determine the precise relationship between the given pair of words (A and B). Be as specific as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Form a Bridge Sentence:</strong> Create a clear, simple sentence that connects A and B. This is the most critical step.</li>
        <li><strong>Test the Options:</strong> Apply the exact same bridge sentence to each of the answer choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Eliminate and Select:</strong> The correct answer will be the pair that fits your bridge sentence perfectly. Eliminate all other pairs that do not fit.</li>
