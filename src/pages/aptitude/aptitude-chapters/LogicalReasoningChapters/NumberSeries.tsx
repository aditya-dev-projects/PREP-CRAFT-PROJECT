      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        Number Series questions are one of the most common types of logic puzzles in placement tests. They are a pure test of your <strong>pattern recognition skills</strong>. A series is a sequence of numbers that follows a specific, logical rule. Your task is to decipher this rule and then use it to find a missing number or the next number in the sequence.

        1. The Core Concept: Finding the Hidden Pattern 🕵️‍♂️
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Every number series is a code. The numbers are not random; they are connected by a hidden mathematical pattern. The most effective starting point is to find the <strong>difference</strong> between consecutive terms. More often than not, the pattern lies in these differences.

            <li><strong>Pattern Identified:</strong> A constant number (+3) is being added to each term.</li>

        <li><strong>Find the Differences:</strong> Always start by finding the difference between consecutive terms.</li>

        <li><strong>Check for a Second Layer:</strong> Find the difference of the differences (the second stage).</li>
        <li><strong>Consider Multiplication/Division:</strong> If numbers change rapidly, the pattern is likely geometric.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for Alternating Series:</strong> If numbers fluctuate (up, down, up, down), look at every other term.</li>
