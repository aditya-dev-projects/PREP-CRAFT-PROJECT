      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        Blood Relations are a common type of logical reasoning puzzle in placement tests. These questions test your ability to understand and map family relationships. The problems are designed to be confusing, but they become very simple if you use a visual approach, like drawing a family tree. The key is to break down complex statements into simple, direct relationships.

        <li><strong>Identify the Question:</strong> After building the tree, re-read the question to ensure you are solving for the correct relationship.</li>
