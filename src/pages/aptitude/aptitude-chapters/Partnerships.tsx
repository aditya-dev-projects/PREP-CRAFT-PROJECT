      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        Partnership problems are a direct and practical application of <strong>Ratios and Proportions</strong>. They deal with scenarios where two or more people start a business together by investing money for certain periods. The core of this chapter is to understand how to distribute the profit or loss among the partners in a fair manner.

        1. The Core Concept: The "Contribution" Principle ü§ù
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        A partnership is a business owned and run by two or more individuals. The profit or loss from the business is divided among them based on their contribution, which depends on both the money invested and the time it was invested for.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
        <li><strong>Partner:</strong> Each individual who has invested in the business.</li>
        <li><strong>Investment (or Capital):</strong> The amount of money contributed by each partner.</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> The duration for which each partner's investment was used in the business.</li>
      </ul>

      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        This is the single most important formula for this chapter. The share of profit (or loss) for each partner is directly proportional to the product of their <strong>Investment</strong> and the <strong>Time</strong> period.

        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> `Profit ‚àù Investment √ó Time`</p>
        <p className="mt-2 font-semibold">`A's Profit : B's Profit = (A's Investment √ó A's Time) : (B's Investment √ó B's Time)`</p>

        3. Types of Partnerships
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Partnerships are generally classified into two types based on the duration of the investments.

        <h4 className="font-bold text-secondary-foreground">Simple Partnership</h4>
        <p className="mt-1 text-muted-foreground">This is when all partners have invested their money for the <strong>same period of time</strong>. The profit or loss is shared in the <strong>ratio of their investments</strong>.</p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-muted-foreground"><strong>Example:</strong> Alice starts with Rs. 50,000 and Bob with Rs. 80,000 for one year. Profit is Rs. 26,000. Find Bob's share.</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
            <li><strong>Ratio of Investments:</strong> `50,000 : 80,000` simplifies to `5 : 8`.</li>
            <li><strong>Sum of Ratio Parts:</strong> 5 + 8 = 13.</li>
            <li><strong>Value of One Part:</strong> Rs. 26,000 / 13 = Rs. 2,000.</li>
            <li className="text-primary"><strong>Bob's Share</strong> = 8 √ó 2000 = <strong>Rs. 16,000</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

        <h4 className="font-bold text-secondary-foreground">Compound Partnership</h4>
        <p className="mt-1 text-muted-foreground">This is when partners invest their money for <strong>different periods of time</strong>. The profit or loss is shared in the <strong>ratio of (Investment √ó Time)</strong>.</p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-muted-foreground"><strong>Example:</strong> Charlie starts with Rs. 20,000. After 4 months, David joins with Rs. 30,000. At the end of the year, profit is Rs. 13,000. Find David's share.</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
            <li><strong>Charlie's Contribution:</strong> 20,000 √ó 12 months.</li>
            <li><strong>David's Contribution:</strong> 30,000 √ó 8 months (since he joined after 4 months).</li>
            <li><strong>Ratio of (Inv √ó Time):</strong> `(20,000 √ó 12) : (30,000 √ó 8)` which is `240,000 : 240,000` or `1 : 1`.</li>
            <li className="text-primary">Since the ratio is 1:1, they share equally. <strong>David's Share</strong> = 13,000 / 2 = <strong>Rs. 6,500</strong>.</li>
