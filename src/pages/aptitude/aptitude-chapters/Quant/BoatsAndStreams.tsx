      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        Boat and Stream problems are a classic application of <strong>Relative Speed</strong>, similar to train problems. The core idea is that the speed of a river's current either helps or hinders the boat's movement. These questions test your ability to calculate the effective speed of the boat when it's moving with the current versus against it.

        1. The Core Concept: The River's Influence ðŸŒŠ
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Imagine you are rowing a boat. If you row in the same direction as the river's current, the river <strong>helps</strong> you, and your overall speed increases. If you row against the current, the river <strong>hinders</strong> you, and your speed decreases. This is the central principle of all boat and stream problems.

        <li><strong>Speed of the boat in still water (B):</strong> The boat's own speed without any influence from the river's current.</li>

        3. The Reverse Formulas (Very Important!)
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        In many problems, you will be given the downstream and upstream speeds and asked to find the boat's speed or the stream's speed. These are extremely useful shortcuts.
      </p>
      <div className="p-4 mt-4 bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary">
        <p><strong>To find Speed of Boat (B):</strong> `B = (Downstream Speed + Upstream Speed) / 2`</p>
        <p className="mt-2"><strong>To find Speed of Stream (S):</strong> `S = (Downstream Speed - Upstream Speed) / 2`</p>
      </div>
       <div className="p-4 mt-4 bg-muted rounded-lg border border-border">
        <p><strong>Example: A boat travels downstream at 20 km/hr and upstream at 12 km/hr. Find the speed of the boat and stream.</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
          <li><strong>Speed of Boat (B)</strong> = (20 + 12) / 2 = 16 km/hr.</li>
          <li><strong>Speed of Stream (S)</strong> = (20 - 12) / 2 = 4 km/hr.</li>

        4. Solving Standard Problems
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">Most problems involve a journey downstream and a return journey upstream. The key is to apply the basic `Time = Distance / Speed` formula using the correct speed (Downstream or Upstream).</p>

        <h4 className="font-bold text-secondary-foreground">Example Problem</h4>
        <p className="mt-2 text-muted-foreground"><strong>Problem:</strong> A boat travels 36 km downstream in 3 hours. It takes 6 hours to travel the same distance upstream. Find the speed of the boat in still water.</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
          <li><strong>Calculate Downstream Speed (D):</strong> Distance / Time = 36 / 3 = 12 km/hr.</li>
          <li><strong>Calculate Upstream Speed (U):</strong> Distance / Time = 36 / 6 = 6 km/hr.</li>
          <li className="text-primary"><strong>Use the Reverse Formula for Boat Speed:</strong> B = (D + U) / 2 = (12 + 6) / 2 = <strong>9 km/hr</strong>.</li>

      <ol className="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
        <li><strong>Read the problem carefully</strong> and identify what is given and what needs to be found.</li>
        <li><strong>Write down the key values:</strong> Speed of Boat (B), Speed of Stream (S), Downstream Speed (D), and Upstream Speed (U).</li>
        <li>Use the primary formulas <strong>`D = B + S`</strong> and <strong>`U = B - S`</strong> if you know the boat and stream speeds.</li>
        <li>Use the reverse formulas <strong>`B = (D+U)/2`</strong> and <strong>`S = (D-U)/2`</strong> if you can first calculate the downstream and upstream speeds.</li>
        <li>Set up your equations using `Time = Distance / Speed`, making sure to use `D` for downstream journeys and `U` for upstream journeys.</li>
        <li>Ensure all units are consistent (usually km and hr).</li>
