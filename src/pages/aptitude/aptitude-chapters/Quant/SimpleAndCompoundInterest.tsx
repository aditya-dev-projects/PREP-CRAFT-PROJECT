      <p className="mb-4 text-muted-foreground">
        Simple Interest (SI) and Compound Interest (CI) are direct applications of <strong>Percentages</strong> that model how money grows over time through investments or how debt increases through loans. These are staple questions in placement tests because they assess your ability to work with percentage growth, both in a straight line (Simple Interest) and exponentially (Compound Interest).

        Every interest problem, simple or compound, involves the same set of characters. Understanding their roles is the first step.

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
        <li><strong>Principal (P):</strong> This is the <strong>original sum of money</strong> that is borrowed or invested. It's the starting point of our story.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate of Interest (R):</strong> This is the <strong>percentage</strong> at which the interest is calculated on the principal. It is almost always specified as a "per annum" (p.a.) rate, which means "for one year".</li>
        <li><strong>Time (T):</strong> This is the <strong>duration</strong> for which the money is borrowed or invested. The time period must be in the same unit as the rate (usually years).</li>
        <li><strong>Interest (SI or CI):</strong> This is the <strong>extra money</strong> earned on the principal (for an investment) or the extra money paid back (for a loan). It's the "fee" for using the money.</li>
        <li><strong>Amount (A):</strong> This is the <strong>total sum</strong> at the end of the time period. It's the original principal plus all the interest earned. (Formula: `Amount = Principal + Interest`)</li>

        2. Simple Interest (SI): The "Flat Rate" Growth üìè
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Simple Interest is the most basic form of interest. The key idea is that the interest is calculated <strong>only on the original principal amount</strong> for the entire duration. The interest earned is the <strong>same</strong> every single year.

      <div className="p-4 mt-4 bg-primary/10 border-l-4 border-primary">
        <p><strong>To find Simple Interest:</strong> `SI = (P √ó R √ó T) / 100`</p>
        <p className="mt-2"><strong>To find Total Amount:</strong> `A = P + SI` or `A = P * (1 + (RT/100))`</p>
      </div>
      <div className="p-4 mt-4 bg-muted rounded-lg border border-border">
        <p><strong>Example: What is the simple interest on Rs. 5,000 for 3 years at a rate of 8% per annum?</strong></p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2 text-muted-foreground">
          <li><strong>P</strong> = 5000, <strong>R</strong> = 8, <strong>T</strong> = 3</li>
          <li><strong>SI</strong> = (5000 √ó 8 √ó 3) / 100 = Rs. 1200</li>
          <li className="text-primary"><strong>Total Amount</strong> = 5000 + 1200 = Rs. 6200</li>

      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2 text-muted-foreground">
        Compound Interest is more powerful. The key idea is that the interest is calculated on the <strong>principal PLUS the accumulated interest</strong> from previous periods. It's "interest on interest," which causes the money to grow much faster over time.
